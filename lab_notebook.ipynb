For each listing, the `.find` method to search within the listing record for specific information, but it's typically still wrapped in the tag.

No, I read a few pages in a book and looked on StackOverflow for answers. Roughly, in order to express the idea \"any year starting with 20xx,\" you can write `20[0-9][0-9]`, and for \"any year starting with 19xx,\" you can write `19[0-9][0-9]`. The `[0-9]`'s act as wildcards for any digit.
